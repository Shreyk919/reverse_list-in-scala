Reverse List using tail recursion

Scala code to reverse a list using tail recursion.

What is tail recursion? 
tail recursion means that the last recursive call in a method/function is recursive. It can also be more easily than normal recursion and in also more efficient.

method reverseList reverses the input list.
Using tail recursion the head (first) element is moved to the new list and the method/function recursively calls itself until the input list is empty.
